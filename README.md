.A repo of my own collections of problem and solutions in bigdata
Problem #1 - The great Indian onion problem in the year 2010. The OnionRmd gives visualizations for onion consumption across the states and although it dosent delve into what caused the actual problem, it gives an insight into the highest consuming states across the years.
Problem #2 - Each state in india contributes to the GDP but which contributes the most and which ones are the laggard. This R mardown does the analysis by using data present on niti aayog's website and identifies the same.
Problem #3 - If we have to sell personal loan, its never advisable that we go directly to all consumers within a given bank. This solution looks at a given data for historical personal loans, tries to build a model using logistic regression to predict who are the most likely customers expected to take a personal loan.
